# Project Audit Findings

## Executive Summary
This document outlines critical architectural improvements needed for the project, focusing on security, performance, and maintainability.

## Critical Improvements

### 1. Environment Configuration
#### Node Version Specification
Add engine constraints to ensure consistent development environment:
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Dependencies Management
#### Package Updates Required
- Several packages require updates to latest stable versions
- Critical update example:
  - `@prisma/client`: v5.7.1 â†’ v5.9.1
  - Benefits:
    - Enhanced `createMany` query performance
    - Improved migration capabilities

#### Missing Essential Packages
##### Health Monitoring
- **@nestjs/terminus**
  - Critical for production deployment
  - Provides health check endpoints
  - Monitors application status
  - Recommended implementation priority: HIGH

##### Security
- **@nestjs/throttler**
  - Implements rate limiting
  - Prevents brute force attacks
  - Adds essential API security layer
  - Recommended implementation priority: HIGH

### 3. Logging Infrastructure
#### Event Logging Implementation
- Implement comprehensive event logging for:
  - Security events
  - Error tracking
  - Application monitoring
- Use NestJS built-in logger:
```typescript
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common';
```
- Recommended log levels:
  - ERROR: For system errors
  - WARN: For potential issues
  - INFO: For important business events
  - DEBUG: For development insights

### 4. Architectural Improvements
#### Service Separation
- Separate following services from main application:
  1. Cron jobs/Background tasks
  2. WebSocket services
  
**Rationale:**
- Prevents cascade failures
- Improves system resilience
- Better resource management

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Small applications:
  - Can maintain as modules temporarily
- Enterprise applications:
  - Must implement as separate services
  - Use message queues for communication

### 5. Code Structure
#### Current Issues
- Complex structure needs simplification
- Inconsistent DTO placement
  - DTOs should be co-located with their entities
  - Implement consistent folder structure

#### Recommended Structure
